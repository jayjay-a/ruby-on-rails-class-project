== Post-Mortem

This Project allowed us to get a hands-on experience with rails and look at the power as well as functionality that comes with a rails app.  A very interesting part of working with rails is interacting with all the possible gems available and being able to find one already made for any function you can think of.  However, dealing with gems can sometimes be problematic, most popular gems have decent documentation other less prominent ones may not. This also requires developers to become familiar with functions that they may not be used to.  Our project team was not too familiar with rails syntax as well as some of its other features which gave us some difficulties during a project.  If given more time or team would experiment more and polish up the project  in areas and maybe lacking.
